## Project Overview

The Western AI Project is an innovative endeavor that focuses on the development of an AI system tailored for online gaming lobbies. Our AI aims to enhance the gaming experience by assisting players with various tasks such as match finding, team balancing, and providing in-game tips and strategies. We have leveraged the YOLO (You Only Look Once) online platform and Python programming language to create this intelligent system.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of our Western AI Project is to:

- Improve the matchmaking process: The AI helps players find balanced and enjoyable matches by analyzing their skill levels and preferences.

- Enhance the gaming experience: Our AI provides real-time tips, strategies, and in-game assistance to players, promoting a more engaging and fulfilling gaming experience.

- Encourage fair play: By assisting in team balancing and discouraging cheating, our AI promotes fair competition within the gaming community.

- Reduce player frustration: The AI minimizes waiting times and provides support, reducing player frustration and enhancing their overall satisfaction.

## Technologies Used

To bring the Western AI Project to life, we employed the following technologies:

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: YOLO is an object detection framework known for its speed and accuracy. We utilized the YOLO online platform to train our AI to recognize in-game statistics and player behavior.

- **Python**: Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language. We implemented our AI system using Python due to its suitability for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

- **Machine Learning**: We employed machine learning techniques to train our AI model on a vast dataset of gaming statistics and player behaviors, allowing it to make informed decisions in real-time.

- **Online Gaming APIs**: We integrated our AI with various online gaming APIs to gather real-time data, enabling our AI to provide up-to-date information and support.

## CUCAI Presentation

We had the honor of presenting our Western AI Project at The Canadian Undergraduate Conference (CUCAI) held at Queen's University in March. During the presentation, we showcased the following aspects:

- **Project Overview**: We provided a detailed explanation of the project's objectives, highlighting its significance in the context of online gaming communities.

- **Technology Stack**: We discussed the technologies used, emphasizing the role of YOLO, Python, and machine learning in the development of our AI system.

- **Use Cases**: We demonstrated how our AI system benefits online gamers by improving match finding, team balancing, and overall gameplay experience.

- **Challenges and Future Work**: We addressed the challenges encountered during the project and outlined our future plans, including expanding the AI's capabilities and integrating it with more gaming platforms.

- **Feedback and Discussion**: We engaged with the audience, inviting questions and feedback to foster discussions and exchange ideas.

Our presentation at CUCAI was a great opportunity to showcase the Western AI Project's potential and receive valuable input from experts and peers in the field.

Thank you for your interest in the Western AI Project. We are excited about the future of AI in online gaming and remain committed to advancing this technology to create more enjoyable and fair gaming experiences for players around the world.
